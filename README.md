# Tab Grouper (Chrome Extension)

A simple Chrome extension that automatically groups your tabs based on custom rules, or lets you group the current tab with a single click or keyboard shortcut.

## Features
- **Automatic tab grouping:** Define rules (e.g., "Title contains ...") to group tabs as soon as they open or update.
- **Manual grouping:** Click the extension icon or use a keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> by default) to group the current tab into a new group.
- **Flexible rules:**
  - Match by page title (more match types coming soon)
  - Group name and color are optional (leave name blank to always create a new group; choose "Random" for color)
- **Easy rule management:**
  - Manage rules from the popup (click the extension icon) or the options page (`chrome://extensions > Details > Extension options`)
- **Modern UI:** Clean, simple popup and options page for rule management.
